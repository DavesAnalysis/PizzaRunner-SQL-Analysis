  🍕 Pizza Runner SQL Analysis

📌 Overview
This project is a SQL case study analyzing the Pizza Runner dataset. From creating tables from scratch to writing queries, the project explores business insights such as revenue, pricing models, customer behavior, and runner performance.



📂 Key Features

Built tables from scratch using SQL scripts.

Answered both guided and self-designed questions on the dataset.

Explored pricing and revenue generation, including scenarios with extras and charges.

Designed and implemented a new runner ratings system with schema and sample data.

Performed joins and aggregations to analyze delivery efficiency and business outcomes.

❓ Sample Questions Answered

💵 If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and a Vegetarian pizza costs $10, how much revenue has Pizza Runner made with no delivery fees?

➕ What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras (e.g., adding cheese)?

⭐ How would you design a new runner rating system, including schema and sample data for ratings (1–5)?

📊 Can we join all delivery information (customer, order, runner, ratings, order/pickup times, delivery duration, speed, total pizzas)?

💰 If runners are paid $0.30/km traveled, how much net revenue does Pizza Runner keep after paying runners?
